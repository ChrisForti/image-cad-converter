**You'll Still Need To:**

- Clean up the CAD file (remove noise, perfect lines)
- Add design intent (constraints, relationships)
- Create 3D geometry from 2D profiles
- Add manufacturing details (tolerances, finishes)??

**Background removal strategies**

1. AI-Powered Background Removal
   We could integrate a client-side background removal tool:

Options:

@imgly/background-removal - Browser-based AI model (~2MB)
MediaPipe Selfie Segmentation - Google's solution
TensorFlow.js with DeepLab - More control but larger
Pros: Very accurate, handles complex shapes Cons: Adds bundle size, processing time

2. Interactive Manual Selection
   Add tools for user to define the subject area:

Click-to-Select Areas:

Magic wand tool (select similar colors)
Polygon selection tool
Brush selection/masking
"Keep" vs "Remove" painting
Pros: User has full control, works with any part Cons: Manual work required

3. Color/Contrast-Based Filtering
   Smart filtering based on the part characteristics:

Adaptive Filtering:

Detect dominant background colors
Edge-based subject isolation
Contrast enhancement focusing on main subject
Color range exclusion tools 4. Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
Combine multiple techniques for best results:
