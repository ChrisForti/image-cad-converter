# Image to CAD Converter

A tool for converting digital images into 2D CAD models using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

## Overview

This project automatically generates CAD models from input images, enabling rapid prototyping and reverse engineering workflows. The system processes 2D images to extract geometric features and reconstructs them as editable 3D CAD files.

## Features

- **Multi-format Support**: Accepts JPG, PNG, TIFF, and other common image formats
- **Edge Detection**: Advanced algorithms for identifying object boundaries and features
- **3D Reconstruction**: Converts 2D profiles into extruded 3D geometries
- **CAD Export**: Outputs to standard formats (STEP, STL, OBJ, DXF)
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple images simultaneously
- **Parameter Tuning**: Adjustable settings for different image types and quality levels
